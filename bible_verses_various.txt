Sirach 2:10  back to the ancient generations and consider this: has the Lord ever disappointed anyone who put his hope in him? Has the Lord ever abandoned anyone who held him in constant reverence? Has the Lord ever ignored anyone who prayed to him?
Sirach 2:11  Lord is kind and merciful; he forgives our sins and keeps us safe in time of trouble. 12 But those who lose their nerve are doomed—all those sinners who try to have it both ways! 13 Doom is sure to come for those who lose their courage; they have no faith, and so they will have no protection.
Sirach 2:13-14 Doom is sure to come for those who lose their courage; they have no faith, and so they will have no protection. 14 Doom is sure to come for those who lose their hope. What will they do when the Lord comes to judge them?
Sirach 2:15  Those who fear the Lord do not disobey his commands; those who love him will live as he wants them to live.
Sirach 2:16  Those who fear and love the Lord will try to please him and devote themselves to the Law.
Sirach 2:17  Those who fear the Lord are always ready to serve him. They humble themselves before him, and say,18 We place our destiny in the hands of the Lord, not in human hands, because his mercy is as great as his majesty.
Romans 8:38-39  I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
